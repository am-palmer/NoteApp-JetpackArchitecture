# NoteApp-JetpackArchitecture
Simple, clean Android notes app using Jetpack components

It makes use of Jetpack components to adhere to a MVVM architecture. Jetpack Navigation with the Safe Args plugin allows for most of the boilerplate to be shifted out of the Activity, giving a blank, zen-like singleton activity pattern that I am proud of.

Todo: I want to completely seperate out all views so that no listeners are needed between any fragments or activities. The app could also do with a way to search and sort notes.
